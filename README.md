diminutive-goblet
=================
This project is an experimental prototype for a turn-based strategy game. It is based on the MASSIVE CHALICE concept (http://massivechalice.com) which makes this a fan prototype, which is a bit of an odd concept.

The bulk of the code for this project is in the diminutive.js file and a live version of the prototype can be played with at http://majugi.com/diminutivegoblet or by cloning this repository and opening the index.html file in a web browser.

This project uses the easeljs library (MIT license) for canvas manipulations.
